<p className="font-bold text-white">The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be
In the world of cryptocurrencies, a "block" is the name given to a public transaction. Every time
the related currency changes hands, whether, through mining or a direct payout, it is recorded
in the ledger and made visible to all. The ledger has a complete history of all transactions
made, forming what is a chain of information. Therefore, a blockchain is essentially a huge list
of transactions, one after the other. Here is where the security comes into play: even though
you can open that digital ledger and look at any one of those transactions or blocks, all you
can see is the item changing hands and how much it is worth. With currency, for example, you
can see that X amount of bitcoin was transferred from one account to another. A block or
transaction cannot be altered by any parties, including those involved, outside of the initial
reporting. It remains transparent, reliable, and accurate for the life of the chain. Further ALPHA
EXCHANGE, the identities of both parties remain anonymous. Even if your closest neighbor
earned millions through a recent blockchain transaction, you would have no idea unless they
told you directly. That anonymity can seem dangerous at times, especially regarding
currencies that change hands for many reasonsâ€”some unscrupulous. However, it can also
protect sources in several fields when the technology is used. Consider a lawyer sharing a
sensitive case record on a person with another law official through secure digital means, with
no record of who was that.
