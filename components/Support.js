The very initial release will be in English only. ALPHA EXCHANGE

ALPHA EXCHANGE will support trading pairs in the following coins:
<br></br>
<br></br>
<ul className='px-10 list-disc'>
<li>ETH</li>
<li>BTC</li>
<li>USDT</li>
<li>LTC</li>
<li>XRP</li>
<li>ALPHA EXCHANGE</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<br></br>
More coins will be added over time. We generally will only add coins that
have strong credibility, user base, and liquidity. If you have a coin that you
wish to see on our Exchange at a later stage, please participate in our ICO.
It'll help you to see your coin listed there.
