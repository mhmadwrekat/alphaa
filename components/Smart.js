<p className="font-bold text-white">A smart contract is just a phrase used to describe computer code that can facilitate the
exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the
blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that
automatically executes when specific conditions are met.
Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed without any
possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud, or third-party interference. Smart contracts help
you exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way
while avoiding the services of a middleman.
The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine.
Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and wait while you get the
document. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e.,
ledger), and your escrow, driver's license, or whatever drops into your account. ALPHA
EXCHANGE so, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement
in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those
obligations. Cryptocurrency Does NOT need to be all speculation .
