The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be
programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.
Financial and technology industries alike are combining in a grand way, giving rise to the birth
of blockchain outside of its normal working conditions. Blockchain is a distributed digital
ledger designed to power and back cryptocurrencies. We need to be familiar with its
underlying technologyâ€”the blockchain Put simply, a blockchain is a ledger of records
organized in 'blocks' that are linked together by cryptographic validation. It is a digital storage
of consensus truth. The key is to understand that this ledger is neither stored in a centralized
location nor managed by any single entity, hence its distributed-ness. The block validation
system results in new transactions being added irreversibly and old transactions preserved
forever for all to see, hence its transparency and resilience. The open-source software that
leverages blockchain technology is called DAPPs.

"As revolutionary as it sounds, Blockchain truly is a mechanism to bring everyone to the
highest degree of accountability. No ALPHA EXCHANGE missed transactions, human or
machine errors, or even an exchange that was not done with the consent of the parties
involved. Above anything else, the most critical area where Blockchain helps is to guarantee
the validity of a transaction by recording it not only on the main register but a connected
distributed system of registers, all of which are connected through a secure validation
mechanism."
