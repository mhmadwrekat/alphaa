Data is knowledge and knowledge should be free.
Think Wikipedia on a grand scale. You trust what you
read on it because it has background checks and other
ways of validating information. Decentralization solves
trust issues by empowering multiple participants to
manage a network. Users do not have to trust a central
authority, and protocols are designed to prevent bad
behavior.

Hacking is not the only issue with centralized
exchanges; in such environments, users do not have
complete control over their funds, but the centralized
exchanges do. This can impose many constraints and
even financial losses on investors. Here your funds, your
information, everything is yours. There can be no
freezes or locks put on what is yours.
